## **Introduction**
Panda Cooler A1 – The Panda Cooler A1 is a high-performance printhead upgrade for your Bambu Lab A1 or A1 mini. This plug-and-play accessory actively cools the stepper motor, reducing temperatures by 15-25°C to ensure reliable performance during long prints. It also features a customizable RGB fan and nozzle light, allowing you to personalize your printer's style. It’s the perfect combination of enhanced functionality and sleek design.


## **Feature Highlights**

- **Smart Cooling System**  
Powered by an integrated ESP32 chip, the Panda Cooler A1 intelligently monitors your print status. It automatically activates to cool the stepper motors while printing and turns itself off during pauses or when the print is done, ensuring a quiet and energy-efficient workspace.

- **H2D Style Status Color Indicator**  
The RGB lighting does more than just look good—it shows your print's progress. The colors display through clear stages (eg.; 30%, 60%, and 100% complete) so you can see how your print is doing from across the room.

- **Multiple Lighting Effects**  
Personalize your printer with 16 million colors and a variety of dynamic lighting effects to match your unique style and workspace aesthetic.

- **Independent Nozzle Lighting**  
A dedicated lighting system provides both style and function. Sync the nozzle light with the fan's RGB for a unified glow, or switch to adjustable white light for clear visibility to check print details and first-layer adhesion.

- **Web UI Wireless Control**  
Effortlessly customize your lighting through an intuitive web interface. You have full control over modes, colors, effects, brightness, and animation speed.
